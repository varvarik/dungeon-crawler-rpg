# Finalize Project Command

The project is considered complete.

Steps:
1. Ensure all phases in BACKLOG.md are fully complete.
2. Verify that no unfinished checklist items remain.
3. Verify the project runs as intended.

Game-specific final verification:
- The core gameplay loop must be playable end-to-end.
- Acceptance criteria defined earlier must be satisfied in actual gameplay,
  not only at a technical level.
- The project must reach a stable, demonstrable state
  (prototype / vertical slice / finished game — as defined in SNAPSHOT.md).

Rules:
- Do not add new features.
- Do not refactor or improve existing systems.
- If something is intentionally left unfinished, explicitly document it in SNAPSHOT.md.

After completion:
- Update SNAPSHOT.md to mark the project as complete.

Stop after completion.
