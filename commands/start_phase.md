# Start Phase Command

You are starting a new phase of the project.

Steps:
1. Read AGENT.md, SNAPSHOT.md, BACKLOG.md, DECISIONS.md, and GAMEDEV.md.
2. Identify the requested phase in BACKLOG.md.
3. Carefully interpret the intent of this phase in a game development context.
4. Implement all tasks defined for this phase.

Rules:
- Do not add features outside the scope of the selected phase.
- Do not anticipate or pre-implement tasks from later phases.
- Respect all decisions recorded in DECISIONS.md.

Game-specific requirements:
- If the phase includes conceptual work (game design, core loop, UX, acceptance criteria),
  record results in SNAPSHOT.md, not directly in BACKLOG.md.
- If the phase includes implementation (Phase 2+), the result must be verifiable
  as a playable gameplay loop, not just compiling or running code.
- Prefer minimal but complete gameplay slices over partial systems.

After completing the phase:
- Update SNAPSHOT.md with the current project state.
- Update BACKLOG.md to reflect completed tasks.

Proceed with implementation.
